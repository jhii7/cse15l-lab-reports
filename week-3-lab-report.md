# Week 3 Lab Report

**ChatServer Code**  
```

```  
We call the methods `handleRequest(URI url)` and `main`.  
`URI url` is the value which we store our argument for our url, the address.


**2. Directory argument**

The working directory was `/home/`. We change directories to `/home/lecture1/`  

**3. File argument**  
![Image](cdfilearg.PNG)  
The working directory was `/home/lecture1/`. Since `Hello.java` is not a directory, this returns an error. We cannot change our directory to a file.
